# These const are being used to control de position of the record in the datafile
#  and the total of fields of that record
# The record is result of the mapfile command, and is a indexed array. In bash
#  indexed array cannot accept index with strings (that should be good in this case)
#  or negative values. So i choose to use a high value, I dont think that we are going
#  to have 99999 fields in the same table. BUT, there is going to be a safecheck
#  for this in table creation
